Riassence Framework Branches


"rc" is the Release Candidate target branch.

It's considered the most stable branch (besides the releases in /tags).
Changes to the "rc" branch are made only when preparing a release or
service version.



"experimental" is the most active development branch.

Experimental undergoes most changes and sometimes it might be broken,
because of some new features being developed that may or may not become future
stable features. Features that are considered stable are merged to the /trunk

Never rely on the "experimental" branch for development or production use,
unless you are actively involved in the core development of the
Riassence Framework itself.

If you need some of the pre-release features, use /trunk instead.
