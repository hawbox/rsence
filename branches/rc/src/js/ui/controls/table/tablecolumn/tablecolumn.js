/** class: HTableColumn
  *
  * An HTableColumn stores the display characteristics and index identifier for a column and determines the width of its column in the HTableControl.
  * It also stores two HView objects: the header view, which is used to draw the column header, and the data view, used to draw the values for each row.
  *
  * vars: Instance variables
  *  type - '[HTableColumn]'
  *  dataView - The data type of the table column
  *  headerView - The data type of the table header column
  *  index - The index identifier of the data column.
  *
  * Extends:
  *  <HControl>
  *
  * See Also:
  *  <HTableControl> <HTableHeaderView> <HTableHeaderColumn>
  *
