/*** = Description
  **
  ** Simple application template.
  **
  ** Depends on <HSystem>
  **
  ** HApplication instances are good namespaces to bind your client-side logic to.
  ** Feel free to extend HApplication to suit your needs. The primary default
  ** purpose is root-level component (<HView>) management and being the
  ** root controller for <onIdle> events.
  **
  ** = Instance members
  ** +views+::    A list of child component ids bound to it via +HView+ and +HSystem+
  ** +parent+::   Usually +HSystem+.
  ** +parents+::  An array containing parent instances. In this case, just +HSystem+.
  ** +isBusy+::   A flag that is true when the app is doing <onIdle> events or stopped.
  **
  ** = Usage
  ** Creates the +HApplication+ instance +myApp+, makes a +HWindow+ instance
  ** as its first view.
  **   var myApp = HApplication.nu(10,'Sample Application');
  **   HWindow.nu( [10,10,320,200], myApp, {label:'myWin'} );
  **

  *                 number means higher priority, affects onIdle polling.
  *
  * +_label+::      A label for the application; for process managers.
