== Introduction

RSence is primarily a flexible and high-performance RIA framework aimed on building responsive, scalable and over-all as high-performance GUI Applications as possible with the chosen technologies. RSence uses the server for backend tasks and the client to provide responsive user interfaces. The server is a highly optimized Ruby framework for writing applications as plugin bundles containing all resources needed per plugin. The client is a highly optimized Javascript framework with an API similar to many object-oriented desktop frameworks. RSence is not primarily targeted for creating html web sites, there are plenty of other tools for that purpose.


== Installation (pre-release):

 gem install rsence --pre

== Setting up a project (TODO; needs to be done manually still)

 rsence initenv /path/of/project

== Project anatomy:

The expected structure of a project environment (where 'project_directory'
is the directory of your project) is:

  [dir]   project_directory   :: The directory of your project.
    [dir]   conf              :: The directory of config files.
      [file]  config.yaml     :: The config file to load by defult.
    [dir]   var               :: Directory containing various runtime files.
      [dir]  run              :: Directory containing PID files.
      [dir]  log              :: Directory containing log files.
      [dir]  db               :: Directory containing database files.
    [dir]   plugins           :: Directory containing installed plugins.

The 'config.yaml' file contains patches specific to your project.

The configuration files are loaded and applied in this order:
  1:  [rsence_install_path]/conf/default_conf.yaml
  2:  [rsence_install_path]/conf/local_conf.yaml
  3:  /etc/rsence/config.yaml
  4:  ~/.rsence/config.yaml
  5:  [project_directory]/conf/config.yaml
  6:  Any files given using --conf parameters, in order of occurrence.
 
The plugins directory contains the plugins installed in the project.

Each command-line tool command takes a number of options, the path defaults to the current working directory.

=== Running in foregrond
  rsence run /path/of/project

=== Running in background
  rsence start /path/of/project

=== Stopiing from background
  rsence stop /path/of/project

=== Restarting in background
  rsence restart /path/of/project

=== Checking if project is running
  rsence status /path/of/project

== RSence command-line tool help

=== Lists all available commands
