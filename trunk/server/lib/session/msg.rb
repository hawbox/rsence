The Message object is initialized as 'msg' in SessionManager.
It's passed around the system as the user/session -object namespace,
much like 'self' is passed around in python methods.

Using the msg object saves considerate amounts of cpu cycles and memory,
because it allows single instances of any classes that handle user data.

Major clean-up in 2008-05-07.

  ### javascript, but is valid for any data.
  def reply(data)
    puts data if $config[:trace]
    @response.body+=data
  end
  
  ### Sends a Magick::Image object to be served, returns a disposable uri.
  def serve_img( img_obj, img_format='PNG' )
    return $TICKETSERVE.serve_img( self, img_obj, img_format )
  end
  
  ### Sends any binary to be served, returns a disposable uri.

    return $TICKETSERVE.serve_file( self, file_data, content_type, filename )
  end
  
  ### Sends any binary to be served, returns a static uri.
  ###
  ### IMPORTANT: PLEASE call unserve_rsrc manually, when you
  ### don't need the resource anymore! Otherwise TicketServe will
  ### keep on chugging more memory every time you serve something.
  ###
  ### HINT: Usually, it's a better idea to use serve_img or
  ### serve_file instead.
