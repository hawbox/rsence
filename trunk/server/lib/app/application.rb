  # For example, reset the state, so the app can be recalled.

  # Extend to handle client calls even if your application was not specifically called.
  def idle( msg )
  end

  # Extend to handle calls, even if specific client calls to application and method are specified.

  # Extend to manage stream or database opening etc..
  # It is called when everything is set to go after all apps are loaded / reloaded.
