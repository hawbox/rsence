Himle Component Sampler

This demo is a showcase of components and a reference of how to utilize them.

/*

First, we create an Application class by extending
the HApplication class and naming the new class
'ComponentSampler'.

All classes are based on the 'HClass' root class.

*/
ComponentSampler = HApplication.extend({
  
  /*
  
  Next, we create a constructor function, but we call
  functions methods, because that's what they are
  inside classes. Every method shares the 'this' object
  with other methods in the same class instance.
  
  Instances are 'clones' of the class they are created
  from by using the 'new' keyword. The stuff inside
  the parenthesis are called arguments. In the case
  of the constructor, these arguments are used when
  a new instance is created like:
  
  var valueIds = {main_tabs:'abcdef',...};
  var componentSampler = new ComponentSampler(valueIds);
  
  After that, any method and instance variable can be
  accessed by using the instance's name and the member's
  name delimitted with a period, for instance:
  
  componentSampler.tabs.selectTab(2);
  
  */
  constructor: function(_valueIds){
    
    /*
    
    The constructor of HApplication initializes the stuff
    that makes an App. To call a similarly named method in
    the class extended from, the special "supermethod"
    'this.base()' can be called. This is what we start with,
    because components require at least an application or
    another component as its parent and it would not be
    possible to do that unless the basics of the application
    itself doesn't exist yet.
    
    */
    this.base();
    
    /*
    
    Next, we make the only argument of ComponentSampler's
    constructor an instance member. In this case, we name
    it valueIds. The underscore used for local variables
    is just a naming convention to easily differentiate
    global and local members.
    
    */
    this.valueIds = _valueIds;
    
    /*
    
    Then, we create a new instance of 'HWindow'. It's just
    what the name suggest; a window component.
    A HWindow is a draggable and resizable container
    component. It means that you can put other components
    inside of it.
    
    You may notice, that it takes three arguments. The first
    one is the description of its position and size relative
    to the zero-point, or origo, of the web browser's window.
    
    In this case, the HWindow's left edge is 100 pixels from
    the left edge of the web browser's window. Its top edge
    is 101 pixels from the top edge of the browser's window.
    Its right edge is 740 pixels from the browser's left edge.
    Its bottom edge is 501 pixels from the browser's top edge.
    
    Basically this means that it's positioned at coordinates
    100,101 relative to its parent (the browser's window).
    Its size is 640 by 400 pixels.
    
    The second argument is the parent of the component. In
    this case it's the HApplication derived class
    ComponentSampler described above. It's accessed via the
    'this' keyword, meaning that it's the default object
    namespace inside methods.
    
    These two arguments are used similarly in any standard
    component, as you will see below.
    
    The third argument is always optional, the 'options'
    block that contain all other arguments. Some common
    ones are 'label' and 'value'. In this case we are
    setting the label of the 'HWindow' instance
    'this.window' to "Component Sampler". It's displayed
    in the title bar of the HWindow.
    
    */
    this.window = new HWindow(
      new HRect(100,101,740,501),
      this, {
        label: 'Component Sampler'
      }
    );
    
    /*
    
    The next component we create is the tabs containing
    all other components.
    
    You may notice that it's extended, almost like
    this HApplication extension. Any component may
    be extended to extend, replace or change its
    behaviour.
    
    In this case we make the extended 'HTab' instance
    'this.tabs' "follow" the right and bottom edges of
    the parent instance ('this.window' we constructed
    above) at a distance of 16 pixels horizonally and
    16 pixels vertically.
    
    Components have flexLeft and flexTop set to true
    by default, so when we set all edges to flex, the
    width of the component is specified automatically.
    
    That's why the right and bottom coordinates of its
    HRect loses meaning.
    
    Its options block is omitted in this example, but
    could contain parameters such as enabled:false to
    disable it. Disabled components can't receive user
    interaction events.

    component. Each 'addTab' call creates and returns
    a new HTabView used as a parent for other components
    and a makes clickable tab label in the tab header
    used for activation of tabs. The second argument
    is a flag, when true selects the tab created.
