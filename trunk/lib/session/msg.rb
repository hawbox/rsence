## The +Message+ instance that contains session and request-response related 
## mappings and utility methods.
##
## The Message object is initialized as 'msg' in SessionManager.
## It's passed around the system as the user/session -object namespace,
## much like 'self' is passed around in python methods.
## 
## Using the msg object saves considerate amounts of cpu cycles and memory,
## because it allows single instances of any classes that handle user data.
class Message
  # Session data placeholder, assigned by SessionManager.
  attr_accessor :session 
  # The session identifier placeholder, assigned by SessionManager.
  attr_accessor :ses_id
  # New session flag, check it in your code to decide
  # what to do, when a new session is encountered.
  # In plugins, this usually means that some Values
  # need to be created and bound or possibly that a
  # user_id mapping needs to be done.
  attr_accessor :new_session
  # Old session first xhr flag, check it in your code
  # to decide what to do, when a restored session is
  # encountered. The old Values are automatically present,
  # so you should at least not re-create or re-bind them.
  attr_accessor :restored_session
  # Contains the source ses on the first request after this
  # session was cloned from another session.
  attr_accessor :cloned_source 
  # Contains the target sessions packed in an array on

  # from this session.

  # by SessionManager, if everything seems ok.
