  ** In contrast of radio button, checkbox can be presented as a single unit. 
  ** State transition of a checkbox is done by clicking the mouse on the button 
  ** or by using a keyboard shortcut. Checkbox view or theme can be changed; 
  ** the helmiTheme is used by default.
  **
  ** vars: Instance variables
  **  type - '[HCheckbox]'
  **  value - A boolean, true when the checkbox is checked, false when it's not.
  **
  ** Extends:
  **  <HControl>
