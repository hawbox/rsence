/** Basic Extension of the HApplication class
  *
  * It's a good place to bind your application objects to. You are free 
  * to name your objects as long as there is no namespace clashes. See
  * The API reference for HApplication to find out what's reserved.
  *
  * It will be extended further in the next steps.
