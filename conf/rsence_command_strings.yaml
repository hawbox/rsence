     of the environment directory. Any database supported by Sequel is supported
     by RSence.
    
     For further information about database connection strings, read the Sequel
     documentation at:
     http://sequel.rubyforge.org/rdoc/files/doc/opening_databases_rdoc.html
    
     You will also need the appropriate ruby driver for the database selected. If
     none is installed, RSence will not be able to store persistent session data
     between server restarts.

  :initenv: |+
    usage: 'rsence initenv [options] [PATH]'
  
    The 'initenv' command creates a new RSence environment. 
  
    The expected structure of a project environment (where 'project_directory'
    is the directory of your project) is:
  
     [d]  project_name       :  The name of your project.
       [d]  conf             :  The directory of config files.
         [f]  config.yaml    :  The config file to load by defult.
       [d]  db               :  Directory containing database files.
       [d]  log              :  Directory containing log files.
       [d]  plugins          :  Directory containing installed plugins.
       [d]  run              :  Directory containing runtime pid files.
       [f]  README           :  Description of the environment directory.
       [f]  VERSION          :  RSence version the environment was created with
  
    The 'config.yaml' file contains patches specific to your project.
  
    The configuration files are loaded and applied in this order:
      1:  [rsence_install_path]/conf/default_conf.yaml
      2:  [rsence_install_path]/conf/local_conf.yaml
      3:  /etc/rsence/config.yaml
      4:  ~/.rsence/config.yaml
      5:  [project_directory]/conf/config.yaml
      6:  Any files given using --conf parameters, in order of occurrence.
  
    The plugins directory contains the plugins that are run in the project.
  
  
    Available options:
  
      --port <number>         The port number the http server listens to.
  
      --addr <ip address>     The IP address or netmask the http server listens to.
                              '0.0.0.0' matches all interfaces.
                              '127.0.0.1' matches the local loopback interface.
                              Defaults to 0.0.0.0
  
      --server <handler>      The Rack handler to use. Defaults to mongrel
  
      --title <title>         The title of the index page.
  
      --database <conn_str>   Use the Sequel connection string to configure the
                              default session database.
  
      --uri-prefix <path>     Configure RSence to use this http "directory" as
                              the prefix. It defaults to the root directory: /
  
      --blank                 Doesn't install the Welcome -plugin.
  
      --non-interactive (-q)  Doesn't ask anything, just creates the environment
                              with the options supplied.
                            
    For further configuration, edit the config.yaml file.
  
  :run: |+
    usage: 'rsence run [options] [PATH]'
  
    The 'run' command starts RSence in foreground (no daemon). Exit with CTRL-C.
  
  :start: |+
    usage: 'rsence start [options] [PATH]'
  
    The 'start' command starts RSence in the background (as a daemon).
  
    Use the 'stop' command to stop RSence.
  
    Use the 'restart' command to restart RSence in the background.
  
    Use the 'status' command to see if RSence is running.
  
  :stop: |+
    usage: 'rsence stop [options] [PATH]'
  
    The 'stop' command stops RSence running in the background (as a daemon).
  
    Use the 'status' command to see if RSence is running.
  
  :restart: |+
    usage: 'rsence restart [options] [PATH]'
  
    The 'restart' command restarts RSence in the background (as a daemon).
    If RSence wasn't running before the 'restart' command was issued, the
    effect is the same as 'start'.
  
    Use the 'stop' command to stop RSence.
  
    Use the 'status' command to see if RSence is running.
  
  :status: |+
    usage: 'rsence status [options] [PATH]'
  
    The 'status' command checks if RSence is running.
    If started with the 'start', 'run' or 'restart' command, a PID file is written.
    Status checks if the PID file exists, if the RSence process responds and if
    the configured TCP port responds in the configured IP address.
  
    Available options:
  
      --conf <file.yaml>      Use additional config file. You can give this option
                              several times. The <file.yaml> is the configuration
                              file to load.
    
      --debug (-d)            Debug mode. Shortcut for several options useful for
                              developers. Not the preferred mode for production.
    
      --verbose (-v)          More verbose output. Also enabled by --debug
    
      --port <number>         The port number the http server listens to.
    
      --addr <ip address>     The IP address or netmask the http server listens to.
  
  :save: |+
    usage: 'rsence save [options] [PATH]'
  
    The 'save' command signals the RSence process to tell the plugins to save their
    data and the session manager to save its session database.
  
    Available options:
  
      --conf <file.yaml>      Use additional config file. You can give this option
                              several times. The <file.yaml> is the configuration
                              file to load.
    
      --debug (-d)            Debug mode. Shortcut for several options useful for
                              developers. Not the preferred mode for production.
    
      --verbose (-v)          More verbose output. Also enabled by --debug
  
  :version: |+
    usage: 'rsence version'
  
    The 'version' command simply outputs the version number of RSence.
  
    RSence follows the standard four-numbered sequence-based version identification
    scheme. The scheme is defined like: major.minor[.maintenance[.package]][.pre]
  
    The major number designates major changes in functionality, sometimes limiting
    backwards compatibility with software written for previous versions.
  
    The minor number designates minor changes in functionality, like minor or
    moderate changes in functinality that usually don't impact backwards
    compatibilty of software written for a previous release with the same major
    version.
  
    The maintenance number designates bug fixes and other minimal changes to
    the release. In a maintenance number change, no new features are introduced.
  
    The package number is a sequence used for the package release. Rubygems
    requires an unique version for each gem released, so pre-releases usually
    occupy the first package numbers of any release.
  
    The '.pre' suffix signifies a pre-release, like "Alpha" or "Beta". To
    install a prerelease version, gem requires the '--pre' command line argument.
    Release versions never have the '.pre' suffix. There are usually several
    package number increments of a new release.
  
    Version number conventions in written text should include both major and
    minor version numbers prefixed with 'RSence'. The maintennance number
    is usally not mentioned unless an issue is fix or such is discussed.
  
    For instance: "RSence 2.0 has undergone some major refactoring since 1.2.1"
