// Simple view for centering a view.
// The rect's left position is used as the minimum left position, the rects
// top and width are used as-is and the HCenterView itself is geometrically
// centered inside its parent by adjusting its "left" style property.
// Designed to be used as a root-level view, listens to the resize event and
// re-calculates the center position accordingly. Likely to evolve a lot still.
