Introduction

Riassence Framework
The Riassence Framework is a Rich Internet Application (RIA) Framework with a
focus on using the server for backend tasks and the client for user interfaces
and the interaction layer. Everything in the middle is abstracted as far as
possible. Essentially all difficult, error-prone and boring tasks are
automated.

The RSence Server is a thin application server with a simple, easy
plugin-based architecture that essentially receives high-level session- and
data-related events from the client. The RSence Client is a powerful, event
powered GUI application framework with advanced operating system like features
and a uniform developer-friendly API that also handles most of the data
routing for you automatically. Most of the time both the user and developer
can easily forget the fact that the Riassence Framework -powered applications
run on the web.


Some highlights:

 * Client supports UI rendering from JSON structures.
   These structures can obviously be stored in YAML- or XML-files as
   well as databases and such.
 * Automatic session management.
 * Secure sessions with one-time session keys using cryptographic
   hashing, so the same key is never transferred twice.
 * Full, skinnable (themeable) Widgets that use a common, uniform API.
 * Plug and play plugin-based server architecture makes deployment as 
   easy as dropping a plugin budle into a plugin directory.
 * Powerful client compression- and packaging system keep the bandwidth
   requirements low.
 * No waste of server- and client CPU cycles; reloading of the web page 
   is not a requirement while using a Riassence Framework -powered
   applications.
 * All operations are asyncronous and smooth by design, the user does 
   not have to wait for the server.
 * RAM-saving single-instance plugin architecture with advanced messaging
   features.
 * Automatic event-based data value management.
 * Wide cross-browser support; most browsers released within ten years are
   fully supported, including mobile browsers like iPhone/iPod Touch Safari
   and Symbian S60.
 * Active, ongoing development since early 2006.
