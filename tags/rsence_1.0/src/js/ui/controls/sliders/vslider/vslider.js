/*** class: HVSlider
  **
  ** HVSlider (vertical version of the slider control) is a control unit that enables the user
  ** to choose a value in a range of values. Sliders support both dragging the handle and 
  ** clicking the mouse anywhere on the slider to move the handle towards the mouse, 
  ** as well as keyboard support after the handle is in active mode. 
  ** Naturally, sliders are commonly used as colour mixers, volume controls, 
  ** graphical equalizers and seekers in media applications. 
  ** A typical slider is a drag-able knob along vertical or horizontal line. 
  ** Slider view or theme can be changed; the helmiTheme is used by default.
  **
  ** vars: Instance variables
  **  type - '[HVSlider]'
  **  value - Numeric value currently set to this object.
  **  minValue - The minimum value that can be set to this object.
  **  maxValue - The maximum value that can be set to this object.
  **
  ** Extends:
  **  <HSlider>
  **
  ** See also:
  **  <HControl> <HSlider>
